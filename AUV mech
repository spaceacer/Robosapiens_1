AUV Mech PROBLEM 

‚óè Mech Statement:
Add a feature to your RC robot that enables you to roll a ball up an inclined
plane at an angle of 35 degrees while attempting to avoid the ball rolling
sideways. There are three marks on the plane, each spaced 15 cm apart, and
the width of each successive section of the incline decreases by 5 cm. You
will score 10 points for passing the first mark, 30 points for passing the
second, and 70 points for passing the final mark.

Keep in mind that you won't receive any points for rolling the ball over without
passing any checkpoints, and that each checkpoint adds the aforementioned
score separately.

What we did:
The concept of our bot was moodularity
To ensure that the ball did not go sideways while climbing we attached two carboard rectangular pieces using parts from mechanix kit and screws.
The ball was supported by the flat piece inbuilt in the white metal chasis
After the problem was successfully solved, we unscrews the cardboard pieces
