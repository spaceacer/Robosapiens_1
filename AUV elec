Elec Statement:
Include a feature in your bot that can recognize collisions
on the front face of the bot, which should be demonstrated
via physical signal, such as a buzzer beep or led
illumination. You can determine the detecting range,
however it shouldn't be greater than 5 cm. Any detection
made over a 5 cm distance will not be rewarded. Perfect
collision detection is also anticipated and will follow you
five times as far as simple detection. The setup will be
static (i.e. asking you to bring your bot towards the
obstacle in steps) and markings will be present near the
obstacle for measuring distances. Depending on the
solution, more creative solutions will earn you more points

Our Solution:
Due to our bot's modularity, we installed two ultrasonic sensors HC-SR04 mounted on fretboard at the front of the bot
This gave us a wider field of view as compared to a single sensor and thus allowed us an effective object detection and hence collision avoidance

The Code:
